## Agenda

### Intro / Agenda bash - What issues make sense today?
### Accessibility: 11am?
* [Web Component ARIA Issue 552](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/552)
* [Web Component and Extensibility Issue 553](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/553)
* Tab index and ARIA role (existing role, not extensibility) for custom elements (see below.)

Dominic (Google): `<button>` produces something that is focusable and has an ARIA role (button). If component authors want to make things focusable/have roles, they need to use attributes: `<my-widget tabindex="0" aria-role="button">`. Experience from three years building web components at Google has shown that relying on attributes is problematic for a few reasons I'll share. I propose we add a couple of options to customElements.define for the default tabindex and ARIA role of custom elements.

## Agenda Candidates
### HTML Modules (as the successor of HTML Imports):
* Dominic (Google) proposed a use case and requirements in [HTML Imports and ES Modules.](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/HTML-Imports-and-ES-Modules.md) TL;DR there's a use case for keeping a component's markup, style and script together in a unit that's integrated with ES module loading.
* Blink is prepared to deprecate HTML Imports for a better, interoperable solution.

### Custom Elements
- https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/468
- maybe https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/176 and https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/113
- More potential callbacks:
  - Parser set attributes. For example, Blink's implementation of input doesn't create shadow DOM until the parser has set all attributes.
  - End tag "done." Most end tag handling is parser state and tree construction management, but script does substantial processing.
  - Participate in form submission.

### Shadow DOM feature requests for v2
- https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/300
- https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/479
